# Introduction
Client is investigating how foreign language teachers feel about and utilize methods from the Teacher Effectiveness for Language Learning (TELL), and seeking advice about how to improving the survey.

Our purpose for our client in this project: 
1.  A lot of people don’t answer the survey because it’s long. Can we reduce the number of questions?
